# Ellipse3DTransform â€“ A Manim Animation Project

This project demonstrates a 3D transformation of an ellipse using the [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) animation engine. The animation includes camera rotations and dynamic deformations to illustrate how an ellipse behaves under linear transformations in a 3D coordinate space.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Visualize a 2D ellipse placed in 3D space
- Rotate the camera around the ellipse to provide multiple perspectives
- Gradually elongate (stretch) the ellipse along different axes
- Help learners understand geometric transformations and linear algebra intuitively

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Manim Community Edition** v0.19.0+
- **Python** 3.10+
- **OpenGL** Rendering (for 3D support)
- Optional: VS Code or any IDE with Python + Manim integration

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/manim-ellipse-3d.git
   cd manim-ellipse-3d
ðŸ“½ Output
The animation renders an ellipse in 3D space, shows rotation from multiple angles, and performs an axis-based stretch to emphasize transformations.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Make sure your system supports OpenGL if you're running in 3D.

Rename your file if it contains spaces, or wrap the filename in quotes when executing.
